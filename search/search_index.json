QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic datasource.name The name of the datasource for which the query should be performed. If Siddhi is used as a Java/Python library the datasource should be explicitly set in the siddhi manager in order for the function to work. STRING No No query The update, delete, or insert query(formatted according to the relevant database type) that needs to be performed. STRING No Yes parameter If the second parameter is a parametrised SQL query, then siddhi attributes can be passed to set the values of the parameters STRING BOOL INT DOUBLE FLOAT LONG Yes Yes System Parameters Name Description Default Value Possible Parameters perform.CUD.operations If this parameter is set to 'true', the RDBMS CUD function is enabled to perform CUD operations. false true false Extra Return Attributes Name Description Possible Types numRecords The number of records manipulated by the query. INT Examples EXAMPLE 1 from TriggerStream#rdbms:cud( SAMPLE_DB , UPDATE Customers_Table SET customerName='abc' where customerName='xyz' ) select numRecords insert into RecordStream; This query updates the events from the input stream named 'TriggerStream' with an additional attribute named 'numRecords', of which the value indicates the number of records manipulated. The updated events are inserted into an output stream named 'RecordStream'. EXAMPLE 2 from TriggerStream#rdbms:cud( SAMPLE_DB , UPDATE Customers_Table SET customerName=? where customerName=? , changedName, previousName) select numRecords insert into RecordStream; This query updates the events from the input stream named 'TriggerStream' with an additional attribute named 'numRecords', of which the value indicates the number of records manipulated. The updated events are inserted into an output stream named 'RecordStream'. Here the values of attributes changedName and previousName in the event will be set to the query. query (Stream Processor) This function performs SQL retrieval queries on data sources.

EXAMPLE 2 @Store(type= rdbms , jdbc.url= jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/das , username= root , password= root , jdbc.driver.name= org.h2.Driver ,field.length= symbol:100 ) @PrimaryKey( symbol ) @Index( symbol ) define table StockTable (symbol string, price float, volume long); define stream InputStream (symbol string, volume long); from InputStream as a join StockTable as b on str:contains(b.symbol, a.symbol) select a.symbol as symbol, b.volume as volume insert into FooStream; The above example creates an event table named 'StockTable' in the database if it does not already exist (with three attributes named 'symbol', 'price', and 'volume' of the types 'string', 'float' and 'long' respectively). Then the table is joined with a stream named 'InputStream' based on a condition. The following operations are included in the condition: [ AND, OR, Comparisons( = = == !=), IS NULL, NOT, str:contains(Table Column , Stream Attribute or Search.String)] EXAMPLE 3 @Store(type= rdbms , jdbc.url= jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/das , table.name= StockTable , username= root , password= root , jdbc.driver.name= org.h2.Driver , field.length= symbol:100 , table.check.query= SELECT 1 FROM StockTable LIMIT 1 ) @PrimaryKey( symbol ) @Index( symbol ) define table StockTable (symbol string, price float, volume long); define stream InputStream (symbol string, volume long); from InputStream as a join StockTable as b on str:contains(b.symbol, a.symbol) select a.symbol as symbol, b.volume as volume insert into FooStream; The above example creates an event table named 'StockTable' in the database if it does not already exist (with three attributes named 'symbol', 'price', and 'volume' of the types 'string', 'float' and 'long' respectively).
